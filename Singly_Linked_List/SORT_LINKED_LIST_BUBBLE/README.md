# This is the program for sortList.c

// In this code, we are implementing sorting of a linked list by simple bubble sort
// This is just for simplicity. The time complexity of this function is O(N^2)

Logic explanation:

-  create a pointer to head: current, temp which has NULL and temp variable to store the swap
-  we iterate through two while loops:
	inner loop: handles swapping 
	outer loop: increments till the end of the list
